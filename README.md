# Task Manager CLI

A lightweight **Command-Line Interface (CLI) Task Manager** written in C++ using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. Keep track of your tasks, mark them as completed, and save them to a file for persistence. Perfect for a simple productivity tool or a portfolio project demonstrating OOP and file handling in C++.
